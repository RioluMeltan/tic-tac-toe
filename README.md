I was bored over the weekend, so I coded together this Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's nothing much, but have fun, I suppose.

If you just feel like playing the game, you can use Pyinstaller to port it to an .exe file. If you want to run it from a terminal or text editor, make sure you have relative directories enabled. You can also change the code/assets if you want. Before you run the code, put the tic_tac_toe_data folder in the directory where you have your tic_tac_toe.py file.
